## 1. Project name:
Task Manager

## 2. Description:
For this project, I created a program for a small business that can help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. The program considers two types of users: “admin” and “general”.
The "admin" user can execute the generally available options listed in the program plus three more exclusive options: “register user”, “generate reports”, and “display statistics”. The "general" user can execute only the general options listed in the menu which are: “add tasks”, “view all tasks”, and “view my tasks”. 
## 3. Contents:
**task_manager.py** - This file contains the whole program. It allows the user to display and manage tasks.<br/>
**tasks.txt** - This file stores a list of all the tasks that the team is working on. <br/>
**user.txt** - This file stores the username and password for each user that has permission to use the program(**task_manager.py**).

## 4. Installation:
To run and use this program is necessary to install a recent version of Python that can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

## 5. Usage:
Copy and run the code contained inside the file task_manager.py on your terminal or IDE. Follow the instructions displayed on the console through the menu and enter the required inputs.
To make the program work you need to create also the two txt files. I advise you to collocate them in the same folder with the file task_manager.py. In case you don't do it,
don't forget to select the txt files path when you read them through the Python file/code.<br/>
Following you can find a screenshot that shows how the program should run:<br><br>

**- Be sure to have on your machine a recent and correctly working version of Python.**

## 6. Credits:
This program was created by me, during the **DfE Skills Bootcamp** provided by **HyperionDev** (https://www.hyperiondev.com/).
